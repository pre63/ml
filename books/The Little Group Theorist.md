# The Little Group Theory

## Chapter 1: Understanding Groups

**What is a group?**

A group is a set $G$ with an operation $\ast$ that combines any two elements to form a third element, also in $G$.

**What are the properties of a group?**

1. **Closure**: For all $a, b \in G$, $a \ast b \in G$.
2. **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \in G$, $(a \ast b) \ast c = a \ast (b \ast c)$.
3. **Identity element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for every $a \in G$, $a \ast e = e \ast a = a$.
4. **Inverse element**: For each $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $a \ast b = b \ast a = e$.

**Example: The set of integers with addition**

The set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition $+$ forms a group with 0 as the identity element and the inverse of $a$ being $-a$.

Perfect!

## Chapter 2: Types of Groups

**What is an abelian group?**

A group where the operation is commutative, meaning $a \ast b = b \ast a$ for all $a, b \in G$.

**Example: The set of real numbers with addition**

The set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ under addition $+$ is an abelian group because $a + b = b + a$ for any $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$.

**What is a cyclic group?**

A group that can be generated by a single element. For some element $g \in G$, every element in the group can be written as $g^n$ for some integer $n$.

**Example: The integers modulo $n$ with addition**

The set $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ under addition modulo $n$ is a cyclic group generated by $1$.

Excellent!

## Chapter 3: Subgroups

**What is a subgroup?**

A subset $H$ of a group $G$ that is itself a group under the operation of $G$.

**What are the criteria for a subgroup?**

1. **Closure**: For all $a, b \in H$, $a \ast b \in H$.
2. **Identity**: The identity element of $G$ is in $H$.
3. **Inverses**: For each $a \in H$, the inverse $a^{-1} \in H$.

**Example: Even integers as a subgroup of integers**

The set of even integers $2\mathbb{Z}$ under addition is a subgroup of the group of integers $\mathbb{Z}$.

Perfect!

## Chapter 4: Group Homomorphisms

**What is a homomorphism?**

A function between two groups that respects the group operation.

**Formally:**

If $G$ and $H$ are groups, a homomorphism $f: G \to H$ satisfies $f(a \ast b) = f(a) \circ f(b)$ for all $a, b \in G$.

**Example: Multiplicative to additive homomorphism**

The exponential function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^+$ defined by $f(x) = e^x$ is a homomorphism because $e^{x+y} = e^x \cdot e^y$.

Excellent!

## Chapter 5: Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem

**What is a coset?**

A coset is a subset formed by multiplying all elements of a subgroup by a fixed element from the group.

**Types:**

1. **Left coset**: $aH = \{ah \mid h \in H\}$ for $a \in G$.
2. **Right coset**: $Ha = \{ha \mid h \in H\}$ for $a \in G$.

**Example: Left cosets in $\mathbb{Z}$ mod $3$**

In $\mathbb{Z}$, the cosets of $3\mathbb{Z}$ are $\{0, 3, 6, \ldots\}$, $\{1, 4, 7, \ldots\}$, and $\{2, 5, 8, \ldots\}$.

**What is Lagrange's Theorem?**

The order (number of elements) of a subgroup $H$ of a finite group $G$ divides the order of $G$.

Perfect!

## Chapter 6: Normal Subgroups and Quotient Groups

**What is a normal subgroup?**

A subgroup $N$ of $G$ where $aN = Na$ for all $a \in G$.

**Notation:**

$N \triangleleft G$.

**Example: Center of a group**

The center $Z(G)$ of a group $G$, consisting of elements that commute with all elements of $G$, is a normal subgroup.

**What is a quotient group?**

The set of cosets of a normal subgroup $N$ in $G$, with the operation $(aN)(bN) = (ab)N$.

**Example: Quotient group of $\mathbb{Z}$ by $2 \mathbb{Z}$**

The group $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ has elements $\{0, 1\}$ under addition modulo 2.

Excellent!

## Chapter 7: Group Actions

**What is a group action?**

A way a group $G$ interacts with a set $X$ by mapping elements of $G$ and $X$ to $X$.

**Formally:**

A group action is a function $\phi: G \times X \to X$ such that $\phi(e, x) = x$ for the identity $e \in G$, and $\phi(g, \phi(h, x)) = \phi(gh, x)$ for all $g, h \in G$ and $x \in X$.

**Example: Symmetric group acting on a set**

The symmetric group $S_n$ acts on the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ by permuting its elements.

Perfect!

## Chapter 8: Sylow Theorems

**What are Sylow $p$-subgroups?**

Subgroups of a group whose order is a power of a prime $p$.

**Sylow Theorems:**

1. **Existence**: For a prime $p$ dividing the order of $G$, there exists a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$.
2. **Conjugacy**: All Sylow $p$-subgroups are conjugate.
3. **Number**: The number of Sylow $p$-subgroups divides the order of $G$ and is congruent to 1 mod $p$.

**Example: Sylow 2-subgroups of $S_3$**

The group $S_3$ of permutations on three elements has order 6. Its Sylow 2-subgroups have order 2, and there are 3 such subgroups.

Excellent!

## Conclusion

**What have you learned?**

Definitions and properties of groups, types of groups, subgroups, homomorphisms, cosets, Lagrange's Theorem, normal subgroups, quotient groups, group actions, and Sylow theorems.

**Are you ready to explore more?**

Absolutely!

**Happy grouping!**
